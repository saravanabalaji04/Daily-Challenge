/*The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must remove every 2nd
integer and
print the remaining integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8
Input Format:

The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
41 69 73 43 5 3
Output:
41 73 5
Explanation:
The 2nd
, 4th and 6th
