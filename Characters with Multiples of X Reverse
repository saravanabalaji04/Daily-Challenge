/*
The program must accept a string S and an integer X as the input. The program must print the
characters which are present at the positions of multiples of X in reverse order as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= X <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains X.
Output Format:
The first line contains the characters which are present at the positions of multiple of X in reverse
order.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack
3
Output:
kri
Explanation:
The characters which are present at the positions of multiples of 3 are i, r and k.
So they are reversed and printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
employee
2
Output:
eylm
