/*
The students of a class has to write two exams in Science and Maths. For the students passing the
exam either a ball or a pen must be given as a prize based on the following conditions.
 - If a ball is given for passing Science exam then a pen is given for passing Maths exam.
 - If a pen is given for passing Science exam then a ball is given for passing Maths exam.
The price of a ball B and the price of a pen P is passed as input to the program. The number of
students N taking the test is also passed as the input to the program. The program must print the
minimum amount A required to buy the prizes for the student.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= B, P <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of B and P separated by a space.
The second line contains the value of N.
The next N lines contain the pass or fail status of N students (1 indicates pass and 0 indicates fail) in
Science and Maths exams.
Output Format:
The first line contains the value of the minimum amount A required.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 10
6
1 0
1 1
1 0
0 1
1 1
1 0
Output:
55
Explanation:
Ball cost = 5 and Pen cost = 10.
Total students who passed Science = 5.
Total students who passed Maths = 3.
If we assign ball to Science and pen to maths, then total cost = 5*5 + 10*3 = 55.
If we assign pen to Science and ball to maths, then total cost = 10*5 + 5*3 = 65.
The minimum cost is 55.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
253 104
