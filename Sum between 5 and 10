/*The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must traverse the given integers and if
the integer 5 is encountered then the following integers must be added till the integer 10 occurs.
Finally, the program must print the total sum as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
2 5 3 2 10 3 10 5 4
Output:
9
Explanation:
The integer 5 occurs at position 2 and the immediate next integer value 10 occurs at position 5. There
are two integers (3 and 2) between them which are added to 5.
The next integer value 5 occurs at position 8 the integers after 5 is 4 which is also added to the result.
Hence the output is 9
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
1 5 5 12 10 5 6 10
Output:
23*/
