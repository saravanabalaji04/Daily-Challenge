/*The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must multiply the first half of the
digits in N as product. Then the program must add the second of the digits as sum. Finally, the
program must add and print the values of sum and product as the output.
Note: Number of digits in N is always even.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N < 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integer based on the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
547856
Output:
159
Explanation:
The first half of the digits are 5 4 8 which are multiplied 5x4x7 = 140.
The second half of the digits are 8 5 6 which are added 8 + 5 + 6 = 19.
The sum and product are added 140 + 19 = 159 which is printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1234
Output:
9
