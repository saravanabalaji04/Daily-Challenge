/*
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input. The program must print the first
row elements multiplied by the last row elements in the matrix, then the program must print the
second row elements multiplied by the last but one row elements in the matrix, then the program
must print the third row elements multiplied by the elements in the third row from the end and so on.
If R is odd the program must just print the elements which are present in the (R+1)/2 row in the
matrix.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= R, C <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain C integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first (R+1)/2 lines contain C integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 3
9 8 4
2 7 8
0 9 2
8 2 4
5 6 7
Output:
45 48 28
16 14 32
0 9 2
Explanation:
The first row elements are 9, 8 and 4 and the fifth row elements are 5, 6 and 7 and their multiplication
values are 45, 48 and 28. So 45 48 28 are printed.
The second row elements are 2, 7 and 8 and the fourth row elements are 8, 2 and 4 and their
multiplication values are 16, 14 and 32. So 16 14 32 are printed.
The third row elements are 0, 9 and 2. As R (which is equal to 5) is odd the third row does not have a
correspoding row to be multiplies and hence only 0 9 2 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 5
7 6 5 2 3
1 9 0 2 4
8 2 4 8 1
0 4 4 2 7
