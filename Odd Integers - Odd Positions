/*The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the odd integers which are
present at the odd positions in the given N integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^3
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the list of odd integer(s) separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
10 13 15 12 31 33
Output:
15 31
Explanation:
The odd Integers are 13, 15, 31 and 33. But only 15 and 31 are at odd positions which are printed as
the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
21 20 27
Output:
21 27
