/*The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must print the product of
the Xth digit from the first and the Xth digit from the last in the integer N as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^18
1 <= X <= Number of digits in N
Input Format:
The first line contains two integers N and X separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the product of the Xth digit from the first and the Xth digit from the last in the
integer N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
34586 2
Output:
32
Explanation:
The 2nd digit from the first in 34586 is 4.
The 2nd digit from the last in 34586 is 8.
So their product is 32 (4 * 8).
Hence the output is 32
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
16840 5
Output:
0
